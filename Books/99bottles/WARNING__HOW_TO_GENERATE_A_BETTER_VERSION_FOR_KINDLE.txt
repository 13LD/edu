The Kindle format is proprietary. Amazon has an official tool for converting
epub to the Kindle format, however it is illegal for us to use it[1] to generate
the kindle version of 99 Bottles of OOP.

Therefore, we've had to generate a .mobi file using an unofficial tool, and the
 result is not as good as the official one.

It's perfectly legal for you to generate the .mobi yourself using Amazon's tool,
kindlegen.

There are two options for getting a better .mobi:

* Uploading it to an online service
* Generating it on the command-line with Amazon's official tool, kindlegen

== Generating with Online Service

Upload the epub to http://www.sendepubtokindle.com, which will email the kindle
version directly to your kindle.

== Generating with kindlegen

Download kindlegen from Amazon's website:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211

Then run the following command on the command-line:

    kindlegen 99Bottles.epub
